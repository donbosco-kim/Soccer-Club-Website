    <div class="about-section-content">
      The Menâ€™s Club Soccer team at Mizzou is a
       chance for MU students who love soccer to
        compete against other college teams. Our 
        league matches happen in Missouri and Kansas,
         making it convenient for players to travel. In 
         the Fall semester, we usually participate in two tournaments: 
         Regionals and Nationals. The season kicks off in September and 
         wraps up around November with the NIRSA Collegiate Club Soccer Tournament.
